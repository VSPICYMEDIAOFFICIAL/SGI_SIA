S.I.A - AI Avatar & Virtual Simulation Integration
This repository contains the development of S.I.A, a groundbreaking system integrating a custom 5G eSIM, AI-powered avatar design, and a sophisticated virtual simulation. It is built using open-source technologies to create a fully autonomous and decentralized system, supporting free global communication, 5G connectivity, and advanced AI avatars with deep learning and emotional intelligence.

Features
1. Custom 5G eSIM (S.I.A)
Global Free Calling & Messaging: No carriers, no tariffs, no SIM cards. Communicate worldwide with 5G internet, voice calls, and messages, even without credit or top-up fees.
Offline Communication: Works even when offline using LoRa (Low Power, Long Range) networks, Mesh Networks, and Satellites.
Global Coverage: Free and untraceable communications globally, including Africa and all other continents.
Decentralized & Secure: Fully decentralized infrastructure with end-to-end encryption for privacy.
Open-Source Hardware: Using open-source CubeSats and LoRaWAN for communication, with the potential to launch its own satellites for full independence.
Public-Access Infrastructure: YateBTS deployment with Open5GS for independent mobile network connectivity.
Free Global Internet: Powered by a global satellite mesh network.
2. AI Avatar Design (SNOW)
Realistic AI Avatar: A super-intelligent, human-like avatar with advanced facial expressions, full-body movements, and emotional responses.
Voice Interaction: SNOW responds via voice, with synchronized lip movements, and detects emotional tones for more personalized communication.
Advanced Features:
Emotion Recognition: Detects and adjusts behavior based on user's emotions.
Self-Evolution: SNOW adapts to user interactions, learning over time.
Gesture Control: Use hand gestures for interactive control, like pausing speech.
Real-Time Personalization: Tracks long-term emotional trends and offers personalized emotional reports.
Holographic Projection: Future integration with AR/VR for a fully immersive experience.
3. Virtual Simulation Integration
AI-Powered Simulation: Simulates real-world scenarios to test both the 5G communication and AI avatar’s adaptability in different environments.
Full Interaction: Users can interact with SNOW in a variety of virtual environments that change dynamically based on both AI and user input.
Advanced Cognitive Abilities: The system is capable of predictive modeling and problem-solving, enhancing the user experience and decision-making process.
